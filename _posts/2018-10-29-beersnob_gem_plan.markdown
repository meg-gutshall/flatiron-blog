## Purpose

App users can choose from a predefined list to learn about different beer styles and their characteristics.

## Layout

The app will welcome the user and display the name of the gem -- BeerSnob. There will be a list of beer style families to choose from numerically.

Once the user chooses a beer style family, a list of beer style names within that family will be displayed to choose from numerically. The user will then select a beer style name and be shown more details.

Each beer style page will show: the style family, the style name, a short description of the beer style, and commercial examples (listing beer name and brewery).

The users will have the option to redisplay the list of beer style families or, upon selecting a family, redisplay a list of that family’s beer styles. Also the option to exit the app is available on every page.

## Planned Future Updates

The plans for this app were severely simplified from the original due to time constraints. Expected future additions are as follows:

### New Information
A-Z characteristics and food pairing suggestions will be added for each beer style along with a style guide detailing the meaning of each A-Z characteristic.

### New Features
The user will be able to access the “A-Z Style Guide” from each beer style page. They will also have the ability to move to the next or previous beer style without backing out to the beer styles list first.
